                                    Getting Started with JSP

Setting Up the Development Environment Overview
    Must Have Java Development Kit (JDK)
    We Must Have the Java Development Kit (JDK) Installed
        -> Visit Oracle’s website to download and install JDK not the JRE
    To Build JSP Applications, we need the following:
        1. Java Application Server -> Tomcat Server
        2. Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) -> Eclipse
    java jdk 9
    https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase9-archive-downloads.html
        jdk-9.0.4_windows-x64_bin.exe
        jre-9.0.4_windows-x64_bin.exe
        -> After that check installed C:\Program Files\Java
    Set Environment Variable
        Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Setting
        In "System Variable" go to "Path" then add Java jdk and Java jre
            C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4\bin
            C:\Program Files\Java\jre-9.0.4\bin
        System Variable -> Add
            Name: JAVA_HOME
            Value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-9.0.4
    After all cmd to check installed: java --version
Installing Tomcat on MS Windows
    Tomcat Version:
        New version of Tomcat 10 was released to support Jakarta EE 9(around February, 2021)
        In this release they renamed the packages, javax.* to jakarta.*
        This is a breaking change for java EE apps
        We will use Tomcat 9
    https://tomcat.apache.org/ -> https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
        32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer (pgp, sha512)
    When install -> Select the type of install: Full
    Username: admin 
    Password: admin
    Turn of option "Show Readme"
    Verify the Installation: http://localhost:8080/
    services.msc -> service(local) -> Apache Tomcat 9.0 Tomcat9 -> Start or Stop
    Stop it and we will start it via Eclipse later 
Installing Eclipse on MS Windows
    https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/
    Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java and Web Developers
    eclipse-jee-2021-03-R-win32-x86_64.zip
Connecting Eclipse to Tomcat
    Benefits:
        Start Tomcat from Eclipse
        Easily deploy Application directly to Tomcat
    Workspace
        C:\Users\vudinhquang\eclipse-workspace
    Open Eclipse and at the bottom section there is a tab called servers and click on it. We do not have any servers
        associated with our Eclipse Environment at the time. So we need to do is click on link and add new server that poits 
        to our Tomcat that we installed
    Apache folder and scroll to select Tomcat 9
        Tomcat installation directly: Tell Eclipse where Tomcat is installed
            C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0

                        JSP Fundamentals

JSP Hello World
    What is a JSP file?
        An HTML page with some Java code sprinkled in
        Include dynamic content from Java code
    Where is the JSP processed?
        JSP is processed on the server
        Results of Java code included in HTML returned to browser
    Where to place JSP file?
        The JSP file goes in our webapp folder
        Must have .jsp extension
    File -> New -> Dynamic Web Project
    webapp -> New -> File -> create helloworld.jsp
    The server canot be started because one or more of the ports are invalid
        Servers -> server.xml -> Server -> port -> change -1 to 8081
    http://localhost:8080/jspdemo/helloworld.jsp
JSP Expressions
    JSP Expression: <%= some Java expression %>
    JSP Scriptlet: <% some Java code: 1 to many lines %>
    JSP Declaration: <%! variable or method declaration %>
    JSP Expression: 
        Compute an expression   
        Result is included in HTML returned to browser
    http://localhost:8080/jspdemo/expression-test.jsp
JSP Scriptlets
JSP Declarations
Calling a Java Class from JSP
    Minimize the scriptlets and declarations in a JSP
    Avoid dumping thousands of lines of code in a JSP
    Refactor this into a separate Java class … make use of MVC
    src/main/java -> New -> Package -> com.luv2code.jsp
    com.luv2code.jsp -> New -> Class -> FunUtils
JSP Built-In Objects
Including Files in JSP
