                                    Getting Started with JSP

Setting Up the Development Environment Overview
    Must Have Java Development Kit (JDK)
    We Must Have the Java Development Kit (JDK) Installed
        -> Visit Oracleâ€™s website to download and install JDK not the JRE
    To Build JSP Applications, we need the following:
        1. Java Application Server -> Tomcat Server
        2. Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) -> Eclipse
Installing Tomcat on MS Windows
    Tomcat Version:
        New version of Tomcat 10 was released to support Jakarta EE 9(around February, 2021)
        In this release they renamed the packages, javax.* to jakarta.*
        This is a breaking change for java EE apps
        We will use Tomcat 9
    https://tomcat.apache.org/ -> https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi
        32-bit/64-bit Windows Service Installer (pgp, sha512)
    When install -> Select the type of install: Full
    Username: admin 
    Password: admin
    Turn of option "Show Readme"
    Verify the Installation: http://localhost:8080/
    services.msc -> service(local) -> Apache Tomcat 9.0 Tomcat9 -> Start or Stop
    Stop it and we will start it via Eclipse later
